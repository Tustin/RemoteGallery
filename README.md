## Requirements

### To build
- .NET 6

### To use
- "Jailbroken" PS4 with an FTP server

1. Enter PS4 IP and FTP port and click connect
2. Your capture gallery games should populate in the list view on the left side (most games should have their proper name, but it will fallback to title id if not found)
3. Select a game to view your gallery

## TODO
- Add support for video
- Allow selecting and download images, and mass downloading entire game gallery
- Sorting and filtering (for games and gallery assets themselves)
- UI cleanup
